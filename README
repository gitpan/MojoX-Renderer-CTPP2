NAME
    MojoX::Renderer::CTPP2 - CTPP2 renderer for Mojo

SYNOPSIS
    Add the handler:

      use MojoX::Renderer::CTPP2;

      sub startup {
         ...

        my $ctpp2 = MojoX::Renderer::CTPP2->build(
          mojo         => $self,

          INCLUDE_PATH => '/tmp;/tmp/project1',
          DELIMITER    => ';',

          CACHE_ENABLE => 0,
          COMPILE_DIR  => '/tmp/ctpp',
          COMPILE_EXT  => '.ctp2',

          template_options =>
            { arg_stack_size => 1024,
              steps_limit    => 1024*1024
            }
          );

          $self->renderer->add_handler( ctpp2 => $ctpp2 );

         ...
      }

    And then in the handler call render which will call the
    MojoX::Renderer::CTPP2 renderer.

      $c->render(templatename, format => 'htm', handler => 'ctpp2');

    Template parameter are taken from $c->stash :

      $c->stash(users => [John, Peter, Ann]);

METHODS
  build
    This method returns a handler for the Mojo renderer.

    Supported parameters are:

    mojo
        "build" currently uses a "mojo" parameter pointing to the base class
        Mojo-object.

    INCLUDE_PATH
        The "INCLUDE_PATH" is used to specify one or more directories in
        which template files are located. When a template is requested that
        isn't defined locally as a "BLOCK", each of the "INCLUDE_PATH"
        directories is searched in turn to locate the template file.
        Multiple directories can be specified as a reference to a list or as
        a single string where each directory is delimited by '":"'.

          INCLUDE_PATH => '/project1/templates/1'

          INCLUDE_PATH => '/myapp/path1:/myapp/path2:path3'

          INCLUDE_PATH => [
            '/project1/templates/1',
            '/myapp/path2'
          ]

        On Win32 systems, a little extra magic is invoked, ignoring
        delimiters that have '":"' followed by a '"/"' or '"\"'. This avoids
        confusion when using directory names like '"C:\Blah Blah"'.

    DELIMITER
        Used to provide an alternative delimiter character sequence for
        separating paths specified in the "INCLUDE_PATH". The default value
        for "DELIMITER" is '":"'.

          DELIMITER => ';'

        On Win32 systems, the default delimiter is a little more
        intelligent, splitting paths only on '":"' characters that aren't
        followed by a '"/"'. This means that the following should work as
        planned, splitting the "INCLUDE_PATH" into 2 separate directories,
        "C:/foo" and "C:/bar".

          # on Win32 only
          INCLUDE_PATH => 'C:/Foo:C:/Bar'

        However, if you're using Win32 then it's recommended that you
        explicitly set the "DELIMITER" character to something else (e.g.
        '";"') rather than rely on this subtle magic.

    CACHE_ENABLE
        The "CACHE_ENABLE" can be set 0 to disable templates caching.
        Default - caching enable.

    COMPILE_DIR
        The "COMPILE_DIR" option is used to specify an alternate directory
        root under which compiled template files should be saved.

          COMPILE_DIR => '/tmp/ctpp'

    COMPILE_EXT
        The "COMPILE_EXT" option may be provided to specify a filename
        extension for compiled template files. It is undefined by default
        used extension '.ctpp2c' .

          COMPILE_EXT => '.ccc'

    template_options
        A hash reference of options that are passed to HTML::CTPP2->new().
